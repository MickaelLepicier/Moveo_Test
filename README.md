The App is on JavaScript and not on TypeScript because I don't know TypeScript, yet.

1. To start the App you will need to install:

# npm install express mongoose dotenv aws-sdk jsonwebtoken bcryptjs morgan @aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider

# npm install --save-dev jest supertest nodemon

2. Then you can run

# npm start

# npm test


The app don't run... there are some Errors that I didn't secede to fix...
