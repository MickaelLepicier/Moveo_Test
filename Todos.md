Create a RESTful API

User authentication via AWS Cognito.

# The code should be clean, well-documented, and follow best practices.

1. Initialize a Node.js project using JavaScript (later on change to TypeScript or ask theme if its ok that the project will be with JS).

2. Use Express.js or any other Node.js framework.

3. Use an ORM like Mongoose for database interaction.

User Authentication:

Implement user authentication using AWS Cognito User Pool (for this task, you can create these users manually).
